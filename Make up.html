    Hi stars,
  </p>
  <p>
    Have you had that experience when you want to start doing your make up and you don’t know how to? So you do it and I turns out like a Picasso painting.
  </p>
<p> 
  Because we’ve all been there and we know how hard it is . Or maybe you just want to do your make up because you don’t feel like getting true the day without it ?
</p>
  <p>
  Because we do and we know it’s hard to get it together. But that’s why we are here to help. In the make up tag u can find the  make up that will suit your face shape the best and the style of make up that represents you the best. 
  </p>
  <p>
    So you can feel look and be “The one”.
